## Resilient
- Let it crash   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- stays responsive in the face of failure         <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- achieved by replication, containment, isolation and delegation       <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- failures are contained within each component    <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- recovery of each component is delegated to another (external) component        <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
